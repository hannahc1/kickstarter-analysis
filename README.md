# kickstarter-analysis
Analysis on Kickstarter data to understand factors for a successful play campaign.
---
***Three conclusions***
1. The $1,000 to $4,900 goal range among the play campaigns has a 73% of success rate.

2. Fever campaign at $2,885 seemed to have had the right size to achieve the positive outcome.
3. Fever was launched in June, one of the two most successful campaign months for theater.

***Limitations***
1. I would limit this analysis to US plays only as play production is a location specific cause, and the funding size in different currencies might not fall into the same goal ranges.
2. I would label any campaigns with 80% funding successful (80% funded sounds good enough to start a project, just like Louise’s Fever -- this might alter the analysis in some meaningful way.

***Additional tables or graphs***
1. I would add a table to show the duration of the campaign and its relationship to outcome as below.  28 days is the one of the most successful time frames among all play campaigns.

2. Louise’s campaign needed just 10 backers with an average donation of $250 to meet close to the target.  Additional graphs demonstrating how average donation size has any impact on the outcome might also explain Fever’s success.
